For some odd reasons, learning new things is kinda fun. Hi, I'm Sagisak. Being a nutjob is fun. I guess for some it's a heinous word? I like it however. Lemonade or tea?
I like anything that is taste yellow. I can be serious, but I just don't want to. Kinda boring. However, I understand why being serious is important. What I don't understand
is people taking away the child-like mind they had. I'm trying to balance that. Serious is for focus, childly-mannered is for ideas. That is why I like to learn new things.
Is actually kinda fun exploring everything, though I can get out of hand.
