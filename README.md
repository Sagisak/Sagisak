For some odd reason, learning new things is kinda fun. Hi, I'm Sagisak. Being a nutjob is fun. I guess, for some, it's a heinous word? I like it, though. Lemonade or tea?
I like anything that tastes yellow. I can be serious, but I just don't want to. Kinda boring. However, I understand why being serious is important. What I don't understand is people taking away the child-like mind they had. I'm trying to balance that. Serious is for focus; childly-mannered is for ideas.

That's why I like learning new things. It's actually kinda fun exploring everything, though I can get out of hand sometimes.
